<p><font color="grey" size="6"><b><i><u>Dear Dad,<br>	
There are so many things I'd like to tell you face to face.<br>
 I either lack the words or fail to find the time or place. <br>
But in this special letter, Dad, you'll find, at least in part, the feelings that the passing years have left in my heart.<br>
 The memories of childhood days and all that you have done to make our home a happy place and growing up such fun.<br>	 
I can still recall the walks we took, the games we played; those confidential chats we had while resting in the shade.<br> 
This letter comes to thank you Dad, for needed words of praise; the counsel and the guidance, too, that shaped my growing-up days.<br>
 No words of mine can tell you, Dad, the things I really feel; but you must know my love for you is lasting, warm, and real.<br>	
You made my world a better place and, through the coming years, I'll keep these precious memories as cherished souvenirs.<br>
Your Son</u></i></b></p>
